#       Implementation for a function call gate. This allows
# 	microthreaded code to invoke plain C functions compiled using
# 	a regular C compiler.
# 
#       The only way to pass data from the parent to a thread with a
# 	full local register window is to use the index register ($l0).
# 
#       Two call gates are provided:
# 
#       __sl_callgate_owntls: the child thread uses its own TLS space.
#        
#       __sl_callgate: the child thread uses the TLS space of its
#       parent. This is appropriate when the caller uses the stack pointer
#       to pass C function arguments (e.g. with varargs)
# 
# Input:  
#       $14 - base register for call parameters
#       [$14 - 8]  number of register arguments
#       [$14 - 16] address of function to call (PV)
#       [$14 - 24] first integer argument (value for $16)
#       [$14 - 32] first float argument (value for $f16)
#       ...
#       [$14 - 104] last integer argument (value for $21)
#       [$14 - 112] last float argument (value for $f21)
# Output:
#       [$14 - 8] return int value
#       [$14 - 16] return float value
#
