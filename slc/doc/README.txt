 Introduction to SLC
=====================

SLC, a generic SVP_ compiler.

Installation
============

To install slc on your system, type in the classical sequence at the
command prompt::

        ./configure
        make
        make install (as root)

Between ``make`` and ``make install``, you may also want to run::

        make check

This will ensure that the demo programs can be compiled with various
slc targets.

Requirements
============

The following tools are used by slc:

- GNU bash 3.x (3.2 or later)

- a standard ISO C99 compiler

- a standard ISO C++ compiler

- the POSIX thread library

The following tools are also required, but can be installed using the
automated deployment Makefile in the separate ``deploy`` package:

- GNU m4 1.4.x (1.4.6 or later), with patches to allow resetting the
  line counter and file name for error messages;

- µTC MT-Alpha core compiler (v4.1.x) with mtalpha binutils

- GCC 4.3.x (or later) configured as cross-compiler for
  alpha-gnu-linux with alpha binutils, with patches to recognize a new
  divide instruction for the DEC-Alpha.

For more details about how to obtain and install the required tools,
check out the document ``doc/requirements.pdf`` or
``doc/requirements.txt`` in the source directory.

Using slc
=========

The SL toolchain comes with several demonstration programs. Looking at
them is a good way to see what slc can support. They can be found in
the ``demo`` subdirectory of the ``sl-programs`` package.

- Headlines about the project can be found in the file ``NEWS`` at the
  root of the source tree.

  software library can be found in CSA notes.
