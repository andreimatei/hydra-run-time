This directory contains code in SL to perform 1-D FFT transforms.

Two alternate implementations with different layouts for the
sine/cosine lookup table are provided. Depending on the memory
implementation they may display different run-time behavior.

The computation kernels are in files `fft_impl1.sl' and
`fft_impl2.sl'; declared in `fft.slh'.

Two "user" programs are provided: `fft_test.sl' and `fft_bench.sl':

- fft_test will perform the forward and inverse FFT on a known vector,
  and optionally print the values. This can be used to check the
  numerical correctness of the computing kernel.

- fft_bench will perform the forward FFT on an uninitialized vector,
  without bit reversal. This is appropriate to benchmark the execution
  time of the kernel itself.

The combination of both programs with both implementations is
performed automatically by the provided Makefile.am.
