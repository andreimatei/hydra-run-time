*** Livermore Kernels in SL ***

This directory consists of the currently (quite) stable versions
of the Livermore Kernels, written in SL.

They were tested on the CSA machine, using the 'current' SL
environment as of 06/07/2009.

To build them, just type:

$ make

(on the command line)

This will build three files for each kernel: the MG assembly, 
the uTC and the MG binary. These files will be placed in 
the directory 'kernels'.

Advanced:

You can also build a simple experiment template for use with the
included 'benchmarker.sh' script. This script will produce fairly
comprehensive results for the execution of the Livermore Kernels
on the mgsim-alpha emulator/simulator. The cycles, FLOPS and 
instruction counts are all placed neatly into a CSV file for
easy importing into your favourite spreadsheet.

To make the experiment template:
$ make exp

To run the experiments:
$ make exprun

The results will be placed in 'kernels/results.csv' .

(HINT: take a look in the bench.exp file for variables that
 you can change)
