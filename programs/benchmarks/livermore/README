*** Livermore Kernels in SL ***

This directory consists of the currently (quite) stable versions
of the Livermore Kernels, written in SL.

They were tested on the CSA machine, using the 'current' SL
environment as of 06/07/2009.

To build them, just type 'make'. This will build three files for
each kernel: the MG assembly, the uTC and the MG binary.
