This directory contains code in SL to perform 1-D FFT transforms.

Two alternate implementations of the FFT kernel with different layouts
for the sine/cosine lookup table are provided. Depending on the memory
implementation they may display different run-time behavior.

The computation kernels are in files `fft_impl1.c' and
`fft_impl2.c'; declared in `fft.h'.
