Acronym for: Configuration Chain Expander

Role: Canonicalize a slc configuration name.

Rationale: the SLC toolchain is specified by a septuplet of component
tags (see SVP inventory); because specifying all 7 is tedious the cce
utility is provided and expands commonly used aliases or partly
misspelled strings to the full and correct form.

Additionally it can check (-c) if configurations are supported or
describe (-d) what is used for each component.
