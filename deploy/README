This directory contains tools to help deploy a SL toolchain on a Unix
box.

Overview
========

The Makefile installs the SL toolchain using GNU make. The process can
be customized by copying the .default files, removing the extension
.default and editing them.

The files are installed in versioned directories so that different
versions can be installed side-by-side. Once at least one version of
the toolchain is installed in a PREFIX directory, copy the script
"slenv" in that directory.

"slenv" provides an interactive menu to select one of the installed
versions and setup environment variables accordingly.

Process
=======

1. if necessary, copy the .mk.default files to .mk and edit as needed.

2. run: ``make MAKE_OPTIONS=-jXX``, where XX is the number of cores on
   the system.
