This directory contains tools to help deploy a SL toolchain on a Unix
box.

The Makefile (Makefile.reqs derived from Makefile-reqs.orig) installs
the SL toolchain using GNU make. See the comments at the start of the
file for details.

The files are installed in versioned directories so that different
versions can be installed side-by-side. Once at least one version of
the toolchain is installed in a PREFIX directory, copy the script
"slenv" in that directory.

"slenv" provides an interactive menu to select one of the installed
versions and setup environment variables accordingly.
